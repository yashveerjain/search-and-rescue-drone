**Overview**

* *The basic concept for this drone is to use computer vision to detect human beings from a cAerial view using quadcopters. We have realized that, while learning it would benefit us more if the work that we do is directed towards solving a social problem or helping them. Recent years of survey have shown that lives are getting endangered in natural and man-made calamities such as floods and fire.*
