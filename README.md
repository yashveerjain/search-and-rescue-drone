**Introduction/Objective **

* *The basic concept for this drone is to use computer vision to detect human beings from a controllable height using quadcopters. We have realized that whilst learning it would benefit us more if the work that we do is directed towards solving a social problem or helping them.Recent years of survey have shown that lives are getting endangered in natural and man-made calamities such as floods and fire.* *
